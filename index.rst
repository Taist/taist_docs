Introduction
============
Taist is a browser extension with which to easily change any web application to tailor it to your specific business needs.

Common use cases:
-----------------
* **add new features**: custom fields to existing entities, whole new entities that interact with existing ones, custom actions and workflows
* **extend workflow** - add new steps or condition checks
* **automate repeatedly executed tasks** - solve them with less number of human actions
* **manipulate several applications** - execute tasks using only one application instead of switching between several ones, manual copy-pasting data, etc.

How it works:
-------------
* Taist uses **addons** - pieces of Javascript code created by users and hosted on our server.
* Each addon implements some changes for a specific web application or website.
* Our browser extension applies addon to their target websites when you visit them.
* If you need more details, please see :doc:`technology description </tutorial/technology>`
