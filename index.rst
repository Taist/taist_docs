Introduction
============
Taist is a tool to add any additional functionality to any cloud application

Taist allows to create **addons** - bundles of Javascript code that are injected to a target application's web page via our `browser extension <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/taist/ncjnldelleedgcfhiohlnccpgfaigbef>`_

What you can do with Taist:
------------------------
* **add new features**: custom fields to existing entities, whole new entities that interact with existing ones, custom actions and workflows
* **extend an existing workflow** - add new steps or condition checks
* **automate repeatedly executed tasks** - solve them with less number of human actions
* **manipulate several applications** - execute tasks using only one application instead of switching between several ones, copy-pasting data, etc.

Why create addons with Taist
----------------------------
We aim to make addons development an important part of the whole cloud software industry, so we create Taist as a powerful platform that helps will help you in every aspect of the addon development.

Now:
