=====

Introduction
------------
Taist is a browser extension to easily change any web application to tailor it to your specific business needs.

Common use cases for Taist are:
- add new features: custom fields to existing entities, whole new entities that interact with existing ones, custom actions and workflows
- extend workflow: add new steps or condition checks
- automate repeatedly executed tasks - solve them with less number of human actions
- manipulate several applications - execute tasks using only one application instead of switching between several ones, manual copy-pasting data, etc.
