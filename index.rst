Introduction
============
Taist is a browser extension and service to easily change any web application to tailor it to your specific business needs.

Taist exists as a service for cloud application vendors that is plugged directly into cloud applications to make them extendable.

Also you can use it via browser extension to extend any cloud application not depending on its vendor - for example, boost up Gmail, Github or any other application you use.

Whom is it for:
---------------

* vendors of cloud applications - for them we have separate, more business-oriented docs - just write to anton@tai.st that you are interested

* **business user** of cloud applications:

  * point your fellow developer or contractor to Taist to implement custom features you need in cloud applications

* **developer or product manager** in a cloud application vendor:

  * quickly roll out and test new features;
  * point your users to Taist as a tool to implement their feature requests

* **developer or project manager** in a systems integrator implementing cloud applications:

  * implement customization requests of your clients

* **independent developer** that uses any cloud applications:

  * add features you need to your favourite cloud applications

What you can do with it:
------------------------
* **add new features**: custom fields to existing entities, whole new entities that interact with existing ones, custom actions and workflows
* **extend workflow** - add new steps or condition checks
* **automate repeatedly executed tasks** - solve them with less number of human actions
* **manipulate several applications** - execute tasks using only one application instead of switching between several ones, manual copy-pasting data, etc.
