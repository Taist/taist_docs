Introduction
============
Taist is a browser extension to easily change any web application to tailor it to your specific business needs.

Whom is it for:
---------------

* **business user** of cloud applications:

  * point your fellow developer or contractor to Taist to implement custom features you need in cloud applications

* **developer or product manager** in a cloud application vendor:

  * quickly roll out and test new features;
  * point your users to Taist as a tool to implement their feature requests

* **developer or project manager** in a systems integrator implementing cloud applications:

  * implement customization requests of your clients

* **independent developer** that uses any cloud applications:

  * add features you need to your favourite cloud applications

What you can do with it:
------------------------
* **add new features**: custom fields to existing entities, whole new entities that interact with existing ones, custom actions and workflows
* **extend workflow** - add new steps or condition checks
* **automate repeatedly executed tasks** - solve them with less number of human actions
* **manipulate several applications** - execute tasks using only one application instead of switching between several ones, manual copy-pasting data, etc.

How it works:
-------------
* Taist uses **addons** - pieces of Javascript code created by users and hosted on our server.
* Each addon implements single enhancement for a specific web application or website.
* Our browser extension applies addons to their target websites when you visit them.
* More details :doc:`here </quickstart/how_it_works>`
