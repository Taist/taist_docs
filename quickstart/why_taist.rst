Why Taist
=========
Everything you can do with Taist you can technically do without it by creating custom browser extensions.

But you will have to solve lots of tasks that are already solved in Taist - creating, deploying and administering browser extension, creating backend for data storage and server logic, user provisioning, etc.

**Taist reduces your development and maintenance costs on orders of magnitude** by solving all the secondary tasks and allowing you to focus on business logic and giving tools to easily manage and maintain it.
