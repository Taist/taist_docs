Writing CSS
===========

Addons can contain additional styles which are applied automatically during addon launch:

* put relative path to the css file to the ``css`` property ob the **manifest**

* check it by hitting ``Save`` on local addon development page: if file is not found, corresponding warning will be displayed.
