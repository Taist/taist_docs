Writing CSS
===========

Addons can contain additional styles which are applied automatically during addon launch:

* create a ``.css`` file and place in the same folder and with the same name as your addon's ``.js`` file.

* check it by hitting ``Save`` on local addon development page: if file is not found, corresponding warning will be displayed.
