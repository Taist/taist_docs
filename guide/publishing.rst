Publishing addons
=================

You can publish your addon for other Taist users.

**! Important**: now all published addons can be used by anyone for free; we are working on other access modes:
* **paid addons** that can be used by anybody for a recurring payment
* **private addons** that can be used only by a specific company

Publishing for the first time
-----------------------------
* Open "Local addon development" page from popup of Taist extension
* Press "Publish addon"; a form to create new addon will open
* Fill the **manifest url** field (a manifest and other source files should be available over http or https)
* Add screenshots and save
* Disable local addon
* Your published addon will appear in the `addons list <http://tai.st/app#/addons>`_. Activate it and check how it works

Updating published addon
------------------------
* Remember to disable current published version of addon while developing new version locally
* To update an addon, just select it from `addons list <http://tai.st/app#/addons>`_ and press `Save` button
