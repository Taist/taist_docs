Publishing addons
=================

You can share finished addon with your colleagues and any other Taist user by publishing it on our site.

**! Important**: now all published addons can be used by anyone; we are planning to create private mode to publish addons only for your company when we get solid demand on it; so, if you need it, please `tell us <mailto:anton@tai.st?subject=Private%publishing%20mode%20request>`_

Publishing first version
------------------------
* Open "Local addon development" page from popup of Taist extension
* Press there "Publish addon"; a form to create new addon will open - fill the **manifest url** field (a manifest and other source files should be available over http or https) and press `Save` button
* Go to `addons list <http://tai.st/app#/addons>`_ - your addon will be visible there for all users. Activate it and check how it works

Updating published addon
------------------------
* Remember to disable current published version of addon while developing new version locally
* To update addon, just select it from `addons list <http://tai.st/app#/addons>`_ and press `Save` button
