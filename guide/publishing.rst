Publishing addons
=================

You can share finished addon with your colleagues and any other Taist user by publishing it on our site.

**! Important**: now all published addons can be used by anyone; we are planning to create private mode to publish addons only for your company when we get solid demand on it; so, if you need it, please `tell us <mailto:anton@tai.st?subject=Private%publishing%20mode%20request>`_

Publishing first version
------------------------
* Fill and save `publishing form <http://tai.st/app#/addons/new>`_ (you can also go to it from extension - from addon development page)
* Go to `addons list <http://tai.st/app#/addons>`_ - your addon will be visible there for all users. Activate it with button to the right and check how it works

Updating published addon
------------------------
* Remember to disable current published version of addon while developing new version locally
* To update addon, just click it from addons list - edit form will open
