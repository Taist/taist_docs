Dependencies
============

Addon dependencies are described here

jQuery
------
jQuery is always available for addons: if it is not included in original website code, it is injected before addons

Other Javascript libraries
--------------------------
We are :doc:`currently working </support/Roadmap>` on easy adding of any libraries in addons.

Until then you can either include them directly into addon's Javascript or load from addon when after is launched.
